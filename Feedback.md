Great work on q1. I didn't see your answers for q2. You were very close in q3, try looking at line 28, maybe there is a bug there? I love how you are asking for user's input in q4! just don't forget that you needed to change background to "light grey". You have a very nice tree in q5, would love to see the final drawing!
